# Write your own challenge!

So you just knocked out the challenge where you go through and figure out what the value is at each step of the way. Awesome work!

Now, make your own. But do it on paper first! Go through and write out 4 values. Then figure out how to get to each of those values using one of each of these: A mathematical evaluation (example: 1 + 2, 4 - 2, 5 * 9, etc.) A conditional statement A Loop A function

Once you are done, console log out each step. Send us the code in an email OR send us a JS Bin link!
